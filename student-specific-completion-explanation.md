-- Student-specific completion tracking explanation

-- Table: student_assignment_completions
-- Structure:
-- id (primary key)
-- student_id (the specific student who completed it)
-- assignment_id (which assignment was completed)
-- completed_at (when it was completed)

-- Example data:
-- student_id: "student_123", assignment_id: 1 -> Student 123 completed assignment 1
-- student_id: "student_456", assignment_id: 1 -> Student 456 completed assignment 1
-- student_id: "student_123", assignment_id: 2 -> Student 123 completed assignment 2

-- This means:
-- - Assignment 1 is completed by both student 123 and 456
-- - Assignment 2 is only completed by student 123
-- - When student 456 looks at their dashboard, they see assignment 2 as not completed
-- - When student 123 looks at their dashboard, they see both assignments as completed

-- Same logic applies to records with student_record_completions table
